# Simpler is Better: Few-shot Semantic Segmentation with Classifier Weight Transformer. ICCV2021.

## Introduction

We proposed a novel model training paradigm for few-shot semantic segmentation. Instead of meta-learning the whole, complex segmentation model, we focus on the simplest
classifier part to make new-class adaptation more tractable. Also, a novel meta-learning algorithm that leverages a Classifier Weight Transformer (CWT) for adapting dynamically the classifier weights to every query sample is introduced to eliminate the impact of intra-class discripency.
